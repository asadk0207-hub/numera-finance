# Google Search Console Cleanup Guide - The Right Way

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Clean up old URLs and set up your new Vercel URL properly

### **Your Current Situation:**
- **NEW URL (Keep):** `https://numera-finance-lk9a.vercel.app`
- **OLD URLs (Remove):** All Netlify, GitHub Pages, old Vercel URLs

---

## **Phase 1: BEFORE Removing Anything**

### **Step 1: Document Current Properties**
1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Click property selector dropdown (top-left)
3. **Take a screenshot** of all properties listed
4. **Write down each URL** you see

### **Step 2: Export Important Data**
For each OLD property that has data:
1. Go to **Performance** â†’ **Search results**
2. Click **"Export"** â†’ Download data
3. Save these reports for your records

### **Step 3: Check Current Rankings**
1. In each old property, note any pages with good rankings
2. Search Google for: `site:old-domain.com` to see what's still indexed

---

## **Phase 2: Add Your New Vercel Property FIRST**

### **Step 1: Add New Property**
1. In Search Console, click property selector
2. Look for **"Add property"** or **"+"**
3. Choose **"URL prefix"**
4. Enter: `https://numera-finance-lk9a.vercel.app`

### **Step 2: Verify Ownership**
**Method A - HTML Tag (Recommended):**
1. Google will give you a meta tag like:
   ```html
   <meta name="google-site-verification" content="abc123..." />
   ```
2. **Share this with me** - I'll add it to your HTML immediately
3. Click "Verify" in Search Console

**Method B - HTML File:**
1. Google gives you a file to upload
2. Share the filename/content with me
3. I'll create it in your docs folder

### **Step 3: Submit Your Sitemap**
1. After verification, go to **"Sitemaps"**
2. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
3. Click **"Submit"**

## **Phase 3: Set Up Proper Redirects (The Right Way)**

### **For Netlify (if still accessible):**
1. Add to `_redirects` file:
   ```
   https://old-netlify-url.netlify.app/* https://numera-finance-lk9a.vercel.app/:splat 301!
   ```

### **For GitHub Pages (if used):**
1. In your GitHub repo settings
2. Add custom 404.html with redirect script

### **Note:** I can help create these redirect files if needed

## **Phase 4: Monitor the Transition (Wait 2-4 Weeks)**

### **Week 1-2: Monitor New Property**
1. Check if new Vercel URL gets indexed
2. Watch for traffic in new property
3. **Don't remove old properties yet**

### **Week 2-4: Check Traffic Transfer**
1. Compare traffic between old and new properties
2. Search for your main keywords to see which URL ranks
3. Check: `site:numera-finance-lk9a.vercel.app` in Google
